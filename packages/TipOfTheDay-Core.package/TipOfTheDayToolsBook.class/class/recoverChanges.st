'While it is an irrefutable fact that Squeak is one of the best and most delightful IDEs from all over the world, it actually will appear in rare cases that you image might crash (although we like to pass the blame on to the user).

After such a crash, you can restore your changes by opening the Extras menu in the docking bar and selecting "Recover changes". Then choose the latest timestamp from the list. In the appearing window, you can select your changes and load them via "filein" in the context menu.!
