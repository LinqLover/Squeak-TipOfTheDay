'You can add custom inspector fields on any object: yellow click (right mouse button) the field list, press "add field...", and enter your watch expression.

Let''s try!! Inspect World, add a field for "self bounds area", and watch how it changes when you resize the VM window.

Good to know: Custom fields also work in debuggers!! For example, bring one up and add a field for "ThisContext methodClass" to the variables inspector on the right.!
