'By default, each DialogWindow is "modally exclusive", which does mean that the resisting windows are disabled until you answer the dialog. However, you can simply release this lock by opening the dialog menu and toggling the "be modally exclusive" option. This will allow you to do some other things before answering the dialog.!
