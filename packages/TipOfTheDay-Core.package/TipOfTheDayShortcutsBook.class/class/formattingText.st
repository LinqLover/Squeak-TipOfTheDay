'Almost every editor in Squeak supports formatting text. To apply a format to a selection, press Cmd (or Alt) plus a number key from 5 to 9. Cmd + 0 removes all your formattings again.

Just try it out in this tip now!!

Usually, you can also save your formattings, but there are two limitations: First, syntax highlighting in code browsers may override some individual stylings. Second, Metacello & Git currently do not preserve any stylings.!
