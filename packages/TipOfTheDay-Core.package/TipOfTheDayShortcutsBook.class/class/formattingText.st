'Almost every editor in Squeak supports formatting text. To apply a format to a selection, press <cmd> plus a number key from 6 to 9. <cmd>0 zeroes all your formattings.

Usually, you can also save your formattings, but there are two limitations: First, automatic code styling overrides individual stylings. Second, Metacello & Squit do currently not support any stylings.!
