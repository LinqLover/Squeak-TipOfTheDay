'Got too many open windows in your Squeak image? There are several tools that can help you:
* The Windows menu in the docking bar, which has a "Find workspace..." option and supports type-to-filter
* Window Manager, a lightweight browser for all open windows, incorporating full-text search
* Window Acrobatics, an award-winning student project with a fancy Alt + Tab view and a window aligner.!
